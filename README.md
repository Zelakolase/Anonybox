## Features :
* **Fast** :<br> It uses smart and fast solutions like [SparkDB](https://github.com/Praudyogikee/SparkDB) which processes requests very fast compared to other DBMS solutions.
* **Military-Graded, Quantum-resistant Encryption** :<br> We use AES-256 ECB PKCS5 Padding to secure every byte.
* **Don't worry about the Files!** :<br> All files are encrypted with a server key, No hacker can read the files.
* **Minimal, does its work** :<br> It's minimal enough to do the job, no complicated code or useless features.
* **INS: (I)nternal (N)aming (S)erver** :<br> Anonybox has a built-in DNS-alike server for multiple routing, useful to bypass blocking by your ISP.
* **High support** :<br> Periodic updates every month to patch vulnerabilities, add new features, or maintain the code till 1 Jan. 2023.
* **Interfaces!** :<br> Introducing Interfaces, You can easily switch the TCP Server to be a HTTP Server or vice versa! (soon)
* **Diffie?!** :<br> Yes, It uses Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange to establish secure connection between the server and the client.
* **Bye Bye, MITM!** :<br> No Man-in-the-middle attacks, since it uses high encryption to transfer data.
